    <p>A smile is a facial expression formed primarily by flexing the muscles at the sides of the mouth. It is <br> believed it takes about 80 muscles to smile. Some smiles include a contraction of the muscles at the comer of the eyes,<br> an action known
        as a "Duchenne smile". Smiles performed without the eye contraction may be perceived as insincere.
